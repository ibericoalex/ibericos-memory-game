# **Iberico's Memory Game - Portfolio Project 2**

Dive into Iberico's Memory Game, a card game challenge inspired by the previous [Portfolio Project 1 - Iberico Alex Photography](https://github.com/ibericoalex/iberico-alex-photography/tree/main). Consider this an engaging extension that complements the original [PP1 website](https://ibericoalex.github.io/iberico-alex-photography/).

In this game, players match cards while racing against time and moves to secure top scores.

**Aim of the project?** To craft a responsive front-end site that adjusts based on user actions, ensuring a tailored experience that aligns with the player's objectives.

## **Design**
For this project, I drew inspiration from the previous [PP1](https://ibericoalex.github.io/iberico-alex-photography/) project to ensure consistency. The website features a bold, minimalist, and sleek design that perfectly aligns with my artistic vision and work.

All the images presented in the project are exclusively captured and owned by me.

### **Colour**
I used the same color code - bold colors like red, black, and white to represent my artistic brand. These colors not only enhance the visual appeal but also ensure easy readability for users. To generate the color scheme, I utilized [Coolors.co](https://coolors.co/ff0000-0d0d0d-fafafa-525252).

![Color palette](./assets/documentation/Color-palette.png)
### **Fonts**
I retained the fonts from the previous project. I incorporated fonts from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) into my website. For the main headers and logo, I selected the font **Roboto**, while for the body text, I opted for **Nunito**. These font choices add a stylish and cohesive touch to the overall design.

### **Wireframes**
Before proceeding with the HTML, CSS or JavaScript coding, I made use of Balsamiq to create the wireframes for my memory card game. This step allowed me to envision and solidify the desired visual structure of the changes I intended to implement from my previous project. By establishing a clear blueprint through a wireframe, I could confidently proceed with the development process.

### Memory Card Game

Iberico's Memory Game features a total of 12 cards, randomly arranged within the grid. The goal is to match each card pair using the fewest moves and in the shortest time. Cards initially face downwards, but when tapped, they disclose a captivating photo from Iberico Alex's portfolio.

### Endgame Modal

Upon successfully matching all card pairs, a congratulatory pop-up emerges, presenting your current score and contrasting it with your previous best if you've played earlier. A CTA (call-to-action) button reading "Play again!" beckons you to take another shot and aim for a better score.

### 404 error message page

A tailored 404 error page is in place for users who may stray via a faulty link. Mirroring the primary site's design, this page presents a CTA button to redirect users back to the intended content.
